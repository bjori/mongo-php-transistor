/**
 * A trait that implements the pecl/mongodb interface BSON\Persistable
 * -- traits however cannot declare that they implement interfaces, so the 
 * class the uses this trait wil need to explicitly 'implements BSON\Persistable'.
 *
 * This trait takes all properties of the using class and stores them in one MongoDB
 * document. By default all object properties will be stored.
 * To customize which properties to use, the __getObjectData() method should be
 * overwritten to return an associative array of the values to store.
 *
 * Change tracking is naive and done by comparing a copy of the original state of the
 * object to its current state. I am sure there are dragons.
 *
 * The _lastModified property will be magically updated in the database on success,
 * but will not be updated in the current object.
 * The _created property will however be accessible property after the initial insert.
 *
 * Two self-explainging convenience methods are defined:
 *  - DateTime function getCreatedDateTime()
 *  - DateTime function getLastModifiedDateTime()
 *  These serve to purpose other then not needing to implement in all classes using
 *  this trait.
 *
 *
 * Note that PHP arrays are not the same as BSON arrays,
 * nor are PHP objects the same as BSON documents (objects).
 * The is similar to the JSON problem, where JSON objects are also ambiguous,
 * and the json_decode() function therefore provides the boolean $assoc option.
 *
 * This creates a slight problem for us as it makes BSON documents ambiguous in PHP.
 * A BSON document can both be represented as PHP associative array,
 * or stdclass objects. By default pecl/mongodb will to literal conversion from BSON
 * document to PHP stdclass, and BSON array to PHP array.
 *
 * It is recommended, for this trait to work appropriately to change the typemapping
 * to always encode BSON documents as arrays. This is done as follows:
 * 
 * $result = $MongoDB\Manager->executeQuery(....);
 * $result->setTypeMap(array("document" => "array"));
 * foreach($result as $object) {
 *     // $object is now instanceof the class who created it
 * }
 *
